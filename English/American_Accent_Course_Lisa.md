## Consonant

Rule one: fully pronouncing each sound
do not take any short cuts; fully move your mouth; fully moving your tongue



aware of moving of your mouth


---
voiced/ voiceless
z/s v/f d/t
do not pronounce a voiced one as voiceless one
vowel is longer vefore voiced consonants
ice(/s/)  eyes(/z/)
back /k/ bag /g/

---

TH:

the tip of tongue touches the upper teeth
air flow come out while touching
do no touch too hard, lightly (v/f should not too hard neither.)

if not touch teeth == s/z
if too hard, will block air flow  == t/d

keep tongue out

---

/L/
发音比中文靠后靠下，接近欧

prolonged and softer, tongue relax, stay in the back of upper teeth

tongue keep up, directly behind the upper teeth, but not pull further(back) like R

---

/R/

American R is never silent
British, people don't pronounce the final R, the R in the at of the word (or R before another consonant)

teacher, for, more, learn (even before another consonant), german,robert, first person

tip of the tongue should not never touch the top behind upper teeth

curl tip of tongue and pyll it back

---

/w/

round lips, air flows out

wait

/kw/ : qu


---

/v/ and /w/

/v/ the lower lip touches the upper teeth

拉扁嘴巴

vest/west


---

/s/ and /z/

speel as s but pronounce /z/:
has, bags
rule: consonant before s is voiceless, then /s/; is voiced, pronounce /z/

care feel doctor + /z/

if before s is a vowels, usually /z/
is, was, these 

/m/ /n/ /l/ /r/ are voiced

---

stops and continuans

another way to divides consonants:
stops: consonant produced need to stop the air flow
/b/
continuants: as long as we can pronounce /s/

prolong the continuant

don't release the stop before a consonants:
pop_music, not popuh music(if you release after second p)
job_market; had_this

American: for the vocabulary end with t/d, do not release, hold it, to make more American

---

T between two vowels

pronounce "T" between two vowels as a fast "D" (even two vowels are in separate word, it is)

better -> bedder

not a very strong /d/, just a fast d

city; water; auto; metal = medal; 


---

"T" followed by "N"

written, hold the 'T' before the 'N', omit 'E'
keep tongue up, don't release, just go to directly to the n
moutain, batten, catten, forgotten


---

ING sound

raise tongue up to the back and keep it, do not release it


---

TR and DR

tr : /chr/ try  (仍然有卷舌) 
dr : softer /d3/ ~= /jr/ dry (仍然有卷舌) drama


---

TU and DU

t before u-> /chew/
statue;nature;picture

d before u -> /d3/ or /jew/
graduate;educate;schedule;individual;

can't you : t also become /chew/
won't you

did you : d become /jew/
could you
would you


---

ED endings
passed tense

waited: + ed /Id/ extra syllable; 
stopped: + /t/
robbed:  + /d/

rule: If the last letter is T or D, 'ed' is a separate syllable;
attempted;painted;attened;


If the last letter is voiceless, 'ed' becomes a voiceless 't'
passed (same as past); cooked;laughed;pushed;watched;

If the last letter is voiced, 'ed' becomes a voiced 'd'

6. stressing words in sentences

content words: words carry the meaning of the sentence - nouns;verbs;adv;adj;

function words: words around the content words

Add some other words at the end:

I coutldn't FIND one for a long TIME.
(PS: 一个从句看成一部分)

7. Focus words and thought groups

divide long sentence into thought groups and decide which word is the most important one in this group-focus word, which is usually in the end.

where to pause to break up depend on your speed; it can also be I will be DRIVING / to the MARKET.



8. how to stress adj and nouns

if there are 2 adj before nouns: we stress first adj and noun, but noun is most stressed. (stress mean longer higher louder)

13. Stress for special Emphasis

any word can be stressed if you want to emphase it (have reason). Don't do this too much.


14. Rising and Falling Intonation = pitch

statement = pitch goes down.

question = yes/no:pitch goes up | WH-:goes down.





15. Changing Intonation

- Items in a series: each item should use rising intonation and the last shoud be failing. ( let people know it is not the last item)

- up = not finished speaking; like a comma;

- introductary words = on the other hand; however; In my opinion .

- giving a choice: do you like PORK or beef.
