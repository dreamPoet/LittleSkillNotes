stressed vowels:

stressed vowels are louder and longer

/ae/
ba-nA-na 
cA-na-da

consider which syllable is stressed?
biOlogy; phoTOGraphy

same thing happened when the word is stressed: noun, verb
in the stressed word of a sentence, make its vowel longer and louder.
I love my new JOB.
i LOVE it.

---
reduced vowels

symbol : the first syllable is stressed and the second is reduced. For the reduced one we don't pronounced fully;
intead of /o/, we pronounce /倒e/, 

local: /倒e/ instead of /a/ or /ae/

Any reduced vowels usually sound the same /倒e/

noun: record : o reduced; stress re
verb: e reduced; stress cord

In a sentence, stress noun and verb, reduce unimportant words: in on at for with by etc.

## Consonant

Rule one: fully pronouncing each sound
do not take any short cuts; fully move your mouth; fully moving your tongue



aware of moving of your mouth


---
voiced/ voiceless
z/s v/f d/t
do not pronounce a voiced one as voiceless one
vowel is longer vefore voiced consonants
ice(/s/)  eyes(/z/)
back /k/ bag /g/

---

TH:

the tip of tongue touches the upper teeth
air flow come out while touching
do no touch too hard, lightly (v/f should not too hard neither.)

if not touch teeth == s/z
if too hard, will block air flow  == t/d

keep tongue out

---

/L/
发音比中文靠后靠下，接近欧

prolonged and softer, tongue relax, stay in the back of upper teeth

tongue keep up, directly behind the upper teeth, but not pull further(back) like R

---

/R/

American R is never silent
British, people don't pronounce the final R, the R in the at of the word (or R before another consonant)

teacher, for, more, learn (even before another consonant), german,robert, first person

tip of the tongue should not never touch the top behind upper teeth

curl tip of tongue and pyll it back

---

/w/

round lips, air flows out

wait

/kw/ : qu


---

/v/ and /w/

/v/ the lower lip touches the upper teeth

拉扁嘴巴

vest/west


---

/s/ and /z/

speel as s but pronounce /z/:
has, bags
rule: consonant before s is voiceless, then /s/; is voiced, pronounce /z/

care feel doctor + /z/

if before s is a vowels, usually /z/
is, was, these 

/m/ /n/ /l/ /r/ are voiced

---

stops and continuans

another way to divides consonants:
stops: consonant produced need to stop the air flow
/b/
continuants: as long as we can pronounce /s/

prolong the continuant

don't release the stop before a consonants:
pop_music, not popuh music(if you release after second p)
job_market; had_this

American: for the vocabulary end with t/d, do not release, hold it, to make more American

---

T between two vowels

pronounce "T" between two vowels as a fast "D" (even two vowels are in separate word, it is)

better -> bedder

not a very strong /d/, just a fast d

city; water; auto; metal = medal; 


---

"T" followed by "N"

written, hold the 'T' before the 'N', omit 'E'
keep tongue up, don't release, just go to directly to the n
moutain, batten, catten, forgotten


---

ING sound

raise tongue up to the back and keep it, do not release it


---

TR and DR

tr : /chr/ try  (仍然有卷舌) 
dr : softer /d3/ ~= /jr/ dry (仍然有卷舌) drama


---

TU and DU

t before u-> /chew/
statue;nature;picture

d before u -> /d3/ or /jew/
graduate;educate;schedule;individual;

can't you : t also become /chew/
won't you

did you : d become /jew/
could you
would you


---

ED endings
passed tense

waited: + ed /Id/ extra syllable; 
stopped: + /t/
robbed:  + /d/

rule: If the last letter is T or D, 'ed' is a separate syllable;
attempted;painted;attened;


If the last letter is voiceless, 'ed' becomes a voiceless 't'
passed (same as past); cooked;laughed;pushed;watched;

If the last letter is voiced, 'ed' becomes a voiced 'd'
robbed;loved;realized;used;called;
