# Little Skill Notes



There are some notes taken when learning some series of short online videos,

such as, mathematics, music, software like PS and so on. (Hope this can be a **"a skill a week"** project)



When  there are enough files which can be organised as a system, they will be moved to a new repository. 



## Current Learning:
